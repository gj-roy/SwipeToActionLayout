SwipeToActionLayout is a layout which helps to implement swipe to reveal behaviour. It is really easy to setup and maintain.

First of all, you need to download it, don't you? ðŸ™‚

## Download from ...

__Important: library was migrated from JCenter to MavenCentral__ 

It means that it may be necessary to add __mavenCentral__ repository to your repositories list

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // your repositories

        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

- Maven

```text
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.st235</groupId>
  <artifactId>swipetoactionlayout</artifactId>
  <version>X.X</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

- Gradle

```text
implementation 'com.github.st235:swipetoactionlayout:X.X'
```

- Ivy

```text
<dependency org='com.github.st235' name='swipetoactionlayout' rev='X.X'>
  <artifact name='swipetoactionlayout' ext='pom' ></artifact>
</dependency>
```

P.S.: The latest code version is mentioned at the version badge at the top of this page.

## Usage

After you have downloaded the library, you need to integrate it. You should declare layout at your xml.

```xml
<github.com.st235.lib_swipetoactionlayout.SwipeToActionLayout
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:sal_gravity="right"
    app:sal_isFullActionSupported="false"
    app:sal_items="@menu/swipe_to_action_menu"
    app:sal_shouldVibrateOnQuickAction="false">

    ... draggable child ...

</github.com.st235.lib_swipetoactionlayout.SwipeToActionLayout>
```

Xml declaration supports the following attributes:

| property | type | description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **sal_gravity** | enum | gravity of your action menu. could be without rtl support, ie left or right, and with rtl support, ie start and end |
| **sal_isFullActionSupported** | boolean | allows you to add support of quick action, which will be revealed on full swipe |
| **sal_shouldVibrateOnQuickAction** | boolean | when quick action will be applied view can perform haptic feedback. set this flag as true if you want to support it. |
| **sal_items** | reference | reference to your xml menu file |

If you decided to use xml-declared menu then you should create menu file by the next rules:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<menu xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto" xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item
        android:id="@+id/call"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_call_black_18dp"
        android:background="@drawable/action_background"
        android:iconTint="@color/iconTint"/>

    <item
        android:id="@+id/email"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_email_black_18dp"
        android:background="@drawable/action_background"
        android:iconTint="@color/iconTint" />

    <item
        android:id="@+id/delete"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_delete_black_18dp"
        android:background="@drawable/action_background"
        android:iconTint="@color/colorAccent" />
</menu>
```

An item supports the following attributes:

| property | type | description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **id** | id | an id of your action |
| **title** | text | a supporting text, will be shown under icon |
| **icon** | reference | a reference to drawable |
| **titleTextColor** | color | a color of your title |
| **background** | reference | a reference to your background resource |
| **iconTint** | color | tint to your icon, allows to change color of it |

PS: all these properties are start with `android` prefix, for example `android:background`

Is is also possible to apply actions programmatically

```kotlin
        swipeToActionLayout.actions =
                listOf(
                        SwipeAction(0xFFFBDAEE.toInt(), R.drawable.baseline_call_24, getString(R.string.action_call), Color.BLACK, Color.BLACK),
                        SwipeAction(0xFFFFF7A4.toInt(), R.drawable.baseline_email_24, getString(R.string.action_email), Color.BLACK, Color.BLACK),
                        SwipeAction(0xFFC0E7F6.toInt(), R.drawable.baseline_duo_24, getString(R.string.action_duo), Color.BLACK, Color.BLACK)
                )
```

To listen lifecycle callbacks from `SwipeToActionLayout` you should implement `SwipeMenuListener`

```Kotlin

swipeToActionLayout.menuListener = MenuListener()

private inner class MenuListener: SwipeMenuListener {

        override fun onClosed(view: View) {
            // empty on purpose
        }

        override fun onOpened(view: View) {
            // empty on purpose
        }

        override fun onFullyOpened(view: View, quickAction: SwipeAction) {
            // empty on purpose
        }

     override fun onActionClicked(view: View, action: SwipeAction) {
         Toast.makeText(this@MainActivity, "On clicked on: ${action.text}", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
         swipeToActionLayout.close()
     }
 }

```

And that is it. Enjoy it!
